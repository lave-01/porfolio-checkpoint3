		<h2>Before You Begin Changing Your Eating Habit</h2>
		<p>First of all, pause, and appreciate yourself for trying again.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This is probably not your first try to eat Healthily, and definitely not your first attempt at trying to
			change your relationship with food.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And that's OK.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>LET IT GO</h2>
		<br>
		<p>You are not your past. You are not your failures. And you are not your eating habits.</p>
		<br />
		<p>In fact - LET IT GO!</p>
		<br>
		<p>All that stuff is just a bag of rocks weighing you down.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So let's put it aside (you can always pick it up again later if you really want to).</p>
		<br>
		<h2>BREATHE</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Slow down and take a deep breath in.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And on the exhale, release your shoulders.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Watch as the knots of stress and anxiety slowly unravel and melt away.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you're not smiling, you can smile now :D</p>
		<br>
		<h2>YOU DO YOU</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Now doesn't that feel better? The lightness of being you. You! It feels good to just be you.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And that's what this is all about. It's about you.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>What type(s) of eaters are you?</h2>
		<br>
		<p>There are several different types of eaters from my observations. It might not be comprehensive but it should
			be expected that they may overlap, but many of us have a predominat type. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Knowing your propensity will help you to make plans and/or set appropriate boundaries that keep you healthy
			and safe. It will also provide information into deeper emotional work to help you make peace and develop a
			healthier realtionship with food.</p>
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Chaotic Eater</b>: This type of eater has no routine and frequently skips meals. They are
				overscheduled and tend to eat on the run. They have no memory of how much or what they have just eaten.
				They eat what is available and never plan ahead.</li>
			<li><b>Unconscious Eater</b>: This type of eater is similar to a chaotic eater. They usually eat while doing
				other things such as working, reading, talking, watching TV or driving. They also eat whatever is
				available and rarely can identify if they are hungry or full.</li>
			<li><b>Emotional Eater</b>: This type of eater uses food to cope with or avoid their feelings. Food is
				numbing for them and they feel powerless around food. They do know they eat too much but often will not
				realize it until after eating.</li>
			<li><b>Waste Not Eater</b>: This type of eater hates to see food go to waste and is always on the lookout
				for a deal. They overeat most often when food is available in abundance, such as all-you-can-eat
				buffets. In the long run, the biggest cost will be on their health.</li>
			<li><b>Refuse Not Eater</b>: This type of eater cannot refuse food for fear they would offend or disappoint
				someone. As a result, they give other people power over what and how much food they eat rather than
				listening to their own hunger and fullness levels.</li>
			<li><b>Restrictive Eater</b>: This type of eater is always on a diet. They are vigilant about reading
				labels, weighing and measuring food which usually leads to vacillating between under eating and
				bingeing. They get very little pleasure out of eating, are fearful of eating with others or food
				prepared by others, and are constantly concerned with what they will eat next.</li>
			<li><b>Intuitive Eater</b>: This type of eater is conscious of their body's hunger signals. They eat until
				they are satisfied and have no fear of overeating. They trust themselves around food and experience no
				guilt about eating food they enjoy. They are conscious and mindful of their food choices, which are
				mostly in favor of their health.</li>
